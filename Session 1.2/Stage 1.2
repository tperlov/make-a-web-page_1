        <h3>What is the World Wide Web?</h3></p>
      <p>The World Wide Web is comprised of billions of HTML pages. It contains every kind of file you can think of. The World Wide Web is comprised of your browser, which connects to the Internet by communicating with servers using a protocol called HTTP.
        Servers are just computers and HTTP is just a protocol that your browser uses to communicate with the server.</p>
      <p>HTTP (HyperText Markup Language) - The main protocol of the web
        <br> Servers - Computers that host the files that make up the web
        <br> Internet - the world’s largest computer network.
        <br> Browser - a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web</p>

        <h3>Basics of HTML</h3></p>
      <p><b>HTML Tags</b></p>
      <p>Tags are instructions on how your page should be structured and are obvious within the code as they are enclosed in “
        <>”. Text after a tag is affected all the way through until a closing tag is hit “
          < />”. Below are some examples. </p>
      <p><b>b</b> is a tag that indicates anything enclosed should be <b>bold</b>.
        <br>
        <b>em</b> indicates <em>italic</em> text.
        <br>
        <b>p</b> is a tag which creates something like a paragraph structure.
        <br>
        <b>br</b> creates a line break. This tag is unique because it doesn't have any contents and therefore does not require a closing tag.
      </p>
      <p><b>Attributes</b></p>
      <p>Some tags have attributes, which in turn have values. For example
        <br>
        <br> The <b>a</b> tag is called an anchor tag and it's how we add in links. The <b>a</b> tag has an href attribute which has a URL value. Between the opening tag and the closing tag is the text which appears hyperlinked. For example I can say, "Dear
        reader, go visit <a href="www.reddit.com">reddit<a>. <br><br>
      Another example uses the <b>img</b> tag to insert images. This tag has two attributes called <b>src</b> and <b>alt</b>. <b>src</b> has a URL value just like href meanwhile <b>alt</b> gives you a word description which is displayed when the image is not loaded and can be used for special settings such as those for the blind. For example, here is an <img src="www.thisiscool.com" alt="Image">. This tag is another example of a tag that doesn't have text contents and therefore doesn't require a closing tag.

  <div><h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3></p>
<p><b>Inline</b> elements are tags that create inline (within the text) formatting. </p>
<p>Examples include <b>b</b>, <b>em</b>, <b>br</b>,and <b>img</b>. Another tag that falls into this category is <b>span</b> which is a container tag.
<p><b>Block</b> elements are tags that create a virtual box around its contents. </p>
<p>Examples include <b>p</b> which creates a block around the paragraph contents. Like with the inline elements, block elements has its own container tag called <b>div</b>.
</p>

    <h3>Blockifying</h3>  
    <p> Blockifying is apparently the technical term for separating elements on a page into compartments. Any page of content can be split up into smaller blocks and sub-blocks. Each of these blocks can be placed into a container like <b>div</b>. This skill can be practiced by either drawing boxes around each element or even by printing the page and cutting the blocks out. Even shapes like circles are really just blocks.
    </p>
    <h3>HTML Structure</h3>
    <p>Aside from blockifying, you can also think of an HTML document as having a tree like structure. You can see this structure by following the indentations along the left end of the HTML code. For example, many trees will start with a <b>body</b> and the next line will have an indented element. This element is the next branch of the tree. Multiple <b>div</b> sections can be either along the same branch or they can be two separate limbs of the tree.
